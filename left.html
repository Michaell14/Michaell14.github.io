Our next guest is a free soloing phenomenon, please welcome Alex Honnold.

Here is what I don't understand.

One little mistake, one little slip, and you fall and die.

Yeah, I mean, uh, you seem to understand it well...

Yeah. Yeah.

And I feel like anybody could conceivably die on any given day.

Soloing makes it feel far more immediate and much more present.

Does it feel different to be up there without a rope?

When you're climbing without a rope, it's obviously like much higher consequence, much, much higher level of focus.

You know, it's a whole different experience.

So it's not like I'm just pushing and pushing and pushing until something terrible happens.

I don't look at it, like, with that perspective.

But maybe that's why it's dangerous for me.

Maybe I'm too close to it and I can't tell that I'm speeding towards a cliff.

Okay.

I like to differentiate between risk and consequence.

You know, when I'm doing these hard free solos I like to think that the risk, you know, the chance of me falling off is quite low even though the consequence is extremely high.

And that's kind of like one of the appeals of free soloing, you know, to take something that seems difficult and dangerous and make it feel safe.

So, do you think that, uh, being a rock climber has been a positive or negative for your dating life?

My dating life?

Yeah.

I think, uh, I think overall it's been a negative.

Um, I just travel too much and I live in a car.

Let's talk through some of the climbing adventures you've had.

The historic free solo climb, Moonlight Buttress.

When I did it, it was like, "Oh," you know, kind of groundbreaking, kind of extreme.

But for me it always felt quite easy and pretty secure.

Well, that wasn't where you stopped, because that next challenge then was free soloing Half Dome.

Half Dome was a huge step for me because it was twice as big as anything I'd ever soloed.

Free soloing is so dangerous that less than 1% of people who climb attempt it.

Alex has done more than 1,000 free solo climbs, but none were tougher than this one.

I got quite scared in some places, and then you start to panic a little bit.

And then you have to, like, reel it all back in.
